# SorceryCraft - Dispelled
Create, Cast, and Wield the magic of the world at your fingertips!

This mod currently supports Minecraft 1.18.

## What are Spells?
Spells are magic scrolls that can be found around the world in chests, or you can create a magic circle out of precious gems and minerals and harness their power to combine a spell with its catalyst in order to create a spell yourself. You can cast spells by right-clicking. There is also a 20% chance (by default) that the spell will rebound and hit you instead, unless you have the "Steadfast" status effect.
